# Iris-Classification
A Capstone project the utilizes K-means clustering to classify Iris species, which also includes a dashboard and final report.


In this repository the classic Iris dataset created bythe British statistician Ronald Fisher is analyzed and used to create a machine learning model via K-means clustering.

To use this code, you can download either the '.py' or the '.ipynb' file, and then upload it into either a notebook or other python enviornment, you will also need to download the iris dataset and put both the project and the dataset into the same folder. Or you can open the google collab link at the bottom, though you will need to upload the Iris dataset to the collab space. From there running the code is fairly straightforward. Github only shows the code file and you have to run the code outside of Github to see the output.

For the ease of viewing, I've included a quickview of the Power BI dashboard, however if you wish to interact with the dashboard, you can download the .pbix file and open it in PowerBI on your personal device. 

And lastly, the final report for this project is included as a Pdf file that you can easily read here on Github.

The dataset utilized in this repository has been provided as a .csv file in this repository, or you can find the dataset on kaggle through the link below.
